		<h1> Who am I? What is this? </h1>
		<p>
		Hello.
		</p>
		<p>
		My name is Mary Rihan and I live in the western suburbs of Sydney. I’ve known since I was ten years old that I wanted to write and become a published author.
		</p>
		<p>
		Two days ago, I decided to make my own website to publish my creative writing and offer a freelance editing service. I charge fifty cents per 100 words of every unedited work. If you want me to read your piece and give you a second opinion, then there is no charge at all.
		</p>
		<p>
		I’m currently in my second year of university. I’m studying a Bachelor of Arts degree with a key program in Psychology, at Western Sydney University. I plan to pursue a career in the editing and publishing industry.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can contact me via email: <a href="mailto:maryrihan@yahoo.com"> maryrihan@yahoo.com </a> for any enquiries.
